About Me
======

<div style="text-align: justify">
Ever since I was a child, I’ve been fascinated by how voices travel through the air—an early curiosity that led me into the world of telecommunications. Today, I’m a passionate and driven Solution Architect with 4+ years of hands-on experience building scalable IT solutions and smart networks at <a href="https://www.digatus.de/" target="_blank">digatus</a>.

I specialize in:
<br>
- IT Carve-out
<br>
- Designing and deploying cloud-native infrastructure (Azure, DevOps, AAD, Veeam)
<br>
- Fully manage the Microsoft 365 environments
<br>
- Administering MDM solutions with Intune (Android/iOS device security, compliance, and enrollment)
<br>
- Creating insights from data using SQL and PowerBI

My international academic and professional journey—from Tunisia to Germany—has given me a multicultural mindset and fluency in 4 languages. I thrive in diverse teams and complex digital projects where innovation meets practicality.

I’m currently helping clients at digatus architect and optimize secure, efficient IT environments. Always open to connecting with fellow engineers, cloud architects, and tech leaders who are passionate about IoT, cloud infrastructure, and digital transformation.

I completed my Master in September 2020 in collaboration between <a href="https://www.https://supcom.tn/" target="_blank">SUP'COM Tunisia</a> and <a href="https://www.uni-passau.de/" target="_blank">Universität Passau</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.fim.uni-passau.de/en/research-and-professorships/former-chairs-professorships/assistant-professorship/team/prof-dr-hans-p-reiser?chash=06304a7d44ea3de05a683d5014dbb2db&tx_publications_pi1%5B%40widget_0%5D%5Bcurrentpage%5D=3&cHash=519564dde62838fca3e2bd702e6e7c89" target="_blank">Prof. Dr. Hans P.
